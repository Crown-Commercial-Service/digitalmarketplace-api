Hi {{ name }},  
  
We are writing to let you know that your email was used to sign up to the [Digital Marketplace]({{ frontend_url }}), but your account already exists. This could be as simple as forgetting that you were already registered or have forgotten your original password.  
  
If you didn’t try to sign up, please ignore this email. If you have forgotten your original password, you’ll need to [reset your password here]({{ reset_password_url }}).  
  
If you need help with this, please email us at [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au).  
  
Thank you
