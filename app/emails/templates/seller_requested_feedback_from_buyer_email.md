Hi Digital Marketplace Buyer,  
  
We are writing to let you know that sellers are requesting feedback for [{{ brief_name }}]({{ frontend_url }}/digital-marketplace/opportunities/{{ brief_id }}) on the [Digital Marketplace]({{ frontend_url }}).  
  
To assist with communications, we request that buyers contact sellers to update them on the progress of the opportunity.  
  
#### We recommend that you contact sellers:  
  
1. who are still waiting during the shortlisting stage 
2. who have been unsuccessful (after the shortlisting stage and the final round) 
  
#### Help with knowing what to write  
If you need help with what to write, we have provided two notification templates for you to use.  


#### Simply copy and paste from these templates and edit as required:  

- Template 1: [response to sellers still waiting during the shortlisting stage]({{ frontend_url }}/api/2/brief/{{ brief_id }}/notification/template_1_response_to_sellers_still_waiting_during_the_shortlisting_stage)  
- Template 2: [response to unsuccessful sellers]({{ frontend_url }}/api/2/brief/{{ brief_id }}/notification/template_2_response_to_unsuccessful_sellers)  
  
If you need further help, please email us at [marketplace@digital.gov.au](mailto:marketplace@digital.gov.au).  
  
Thank you,
